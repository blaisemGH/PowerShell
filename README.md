# PowerShell
My PowerShell repository

This is my repository of profile functions. All of the above files constitute 80% of my profile. The remainder and my modules are connected to proprietary software so are not able to be shared. These functions are what I use to improve my CLI experience.

### profile-settings.ps1

  A template of my console settings and generic shortcusts. I set my terminal background to 15:15:15 r:g:b.

# Functions

### Import-YamlFile

* This function takes an input yaml file and outputs a hashtable, e.g., `Import-Yaml -Path file.yaml` or `Get-Item file.yaml | Import-Yaml`. It's analogous to the standard `Import-Csv` cmdlet, except it outputs a hashtable. I'll be adding in a pipeable function to convert hashtables to objects. I use this to create a yaml config interface to a batch module to expose a familiar interface to my powershell code for end users.

### ConvertFrom-Yaml

* This function is similar to `ConvertFrom-Json`, but it takes YAML code and converts it into a hashtable. It is currently embedded in the `Import-YamlFile` file and was added for completeness, as one can now import from a yaml file like `Import-Csv` or from raw yaml code like `ConvertFrom-Json`.

### Export-PowerShellDataFile

* This function takes an object and writes it to a new .psd1 file, similar to Export-CSV. This means you can now convert from other file formats to a PowerShellDataFile, e.g., `Get-Content file.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json | Export-PowerShellDataFile -Path config.psd1`. It is backed by my supporting function `ConvertTo-PowerShellDataFile`, which converts any generic PS object to literal PS code. `ConvertTo-PowerShellDataFile` is inspired by the function [from Dave-Wyatt](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34383464/6076137).

  Keep in mind the psd1 format is designed for humble config filesâ€”don't export a giant csv to psd1 ;). Furthermore, it cannot import a collection of configs, such as what comes from `Invoke-WebRequest 'https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues' | ConvertFrom-Json | Export-PowerShellDataFile -path issues.psd1; Import-PowerShellDataFile issues.psd1`. However, for a collection of configs, you can still import it via `Invoke-Expression ((Get-Content issues.psd1) -join [Environment]::NewLine)`.

  While this limitation of `Import-PowerShellDataFile` may seem unfortunate; on the other hand, it enforces a simple syntax that can't be overcomplicated or exploited. If you run into this limitation, probably you have complex configs / thousands of lines, and it's simply better to stick with json or `Export-CliXml`. PSD1 should be used for a single, simple config that needs to be more human readable than json/xml, but you wish to avoid yaml or interop better natively with PS.

### Checkpoint-ModuleVersion
* This function contains comment-based help for its description. Please refer to this for more information. Background: Since I work in closed environments at customers, I desired a means of offline version control for my modules. This function was my approach. Even if using Git, it can still streamline your workflow as it presents a convenient means to update your module version and archive it.

### Find-StringRecursively (alias fsr or grep)
* This is basically a recursive `Select-String` and is equivalent to Bash's `grep -ir`. It has additional formatting to improve readability and leverages .NET to retrieve files, only resorting to `Get-ChildItem` if the .NET method fails. For file search parameters, one can specify a filter on the files and deactivate recursion if desired. The Select-String parameters are all available as of PS 5.1.

### Get-Dir (alias gd)
* An alternative to `Get-ChildItem`. The attributes column is displayed more prominently, and the length column is properly filled for folders. All columns have been reformatted to fixed widths for readability, and the length column is rounded to the nearest unit. Finally, this supports a tree parameter for viewing files in a tree format. There are hidden parameters to enable sorting, e.g., on directory size via `length`.

### Get-ItemSize (alias gs or du)
* Sizes directories similar to `du -sh` in Bash. Automatically infers the closest unit (KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, etc.), but you can specify the unit explicitly via input parameter. I've left the fullname, name, and length as hidden properties to enable sorting or selects.

### Group-ObjectFixed (alias grp)
* This addresses a performance bug in `Group-Object` in V5.1 that causes it to run unbearably long for moderately sized objects or larger. I had borrowed a fixed version from stackOverflow that didn't output the same object properties as `Group-Object`, so I made this function to correct the object output. I have since found the same function [at powershell.one](https://powershell.one/tricks/performance/group-object), which already has the corrected output. I assume this was the original source, and I either copied it wrong or had an incomplete version from somewhere else. This original version also has a nice switch parameter to speed up cases where you just want to count, a feature the original `Group-Object` also offers that I didn't know about. So the linked function is more complete and original. Credit where credit is due. powershell.one is an awesome site.

### Out-AllMembersGrid
* This cmdlet normalizes object headers in collections. This addresses an issue with, e.g., Import-CSV, where your Format-Table doesn't display all of the properties. Instead of piping into format-table, you can pipe into this cmdlet (or remove the Out-GridView and pipe into Format-Table).

  The cause of this bug is that, in PowerShell, the first object in a collection sets the headers for all subsequent objects in the collections, even if they have different headers. This means adding additional objects with different headers will cause them to only display the headers in common with the first object. This function forces the first object in the collection to contain all headers present in any object within the collection, so that every possible header can be displayed.

### Replace-StringInFile (alias rs or sed)
* Replaces strings in files according to a RegEx pattern, similar to `sed -i` but with much improved features. Use `-Recurse` to pull files recursively for replacement. One of my most useful cmdlets. Note that `-IncludeCommentedLines` is needed if you wish to update text in lines starting with #.

### Test-ValidArgs
* Validates arguments against a set of allowed values. Say you want to test if a collection contains 'a' or 'b'. You would submit a validation hashset containing @('a','b') and then your test collection as a hashset. If your test collection does not contain either value in the validation set, then it throws an error; if it contains both values, then it also throws an error. The latter throw for containing more than 1 value in the validation set can be deactivated (see lines 20+), but if that's your use-case, then you can simply use -in and don't need this function ;)

  The purpose of this comes from a batch job module I have where my parameter with attribute `[ValueFromRemainingArguments]` is used in 2 different contexts. In one context, I am running a batch of data loading, and in the other context, I am exporting certain data and require additional flags to select that data. I can only have 1 ValueFromRemainingArguments parameter, and my parameter sets are already complex, so I cannot comfortably split this into a different parameter for each context. Therefore, I need a way to dynamically validate this parameter later in the script. That's what this function accomplishes. It can be generically used in any scenario where you need to validate a set and enforce no duplicate matches.

### Update-FileVersionIncrement

* I have a module which aggregates CSVs into 1 file and exports this to a network drive.  Occasionally, the file will be rewritten as new data is delivered. I needed a means to update the file version and wrote this function.

  This function inserts a version marker into the filename, just before the extension, e.g., filename-v01.ext. The 'v' can be configured in the input parameter. The '-' is default; however, if the file uses this convention already (<filename>?v##.<ext>), then the ? in ?v## can be a different character, and the function will infer that and use it. If no version is present in the filename, then it will default to -v01, and thereafter it will increment it by 1, e.g., v02, v03, v04 etc. If the file doesn't exist yet, then it will be created with -v01.
